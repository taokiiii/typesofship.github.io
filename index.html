<h2>Types Of Ships</h2>

<p>
Ships-any large floating vessel capable of crossing open waters, 
as opposed to a boat, which is generally a smaller craft The term 
formerly was applied to sailing vessels having three or more masts;
in modern times it usually denotes a vessel of more than 500 tons of displacement.

<p>
The great majority of ships that are neither military vessels nor yachts can be divided into several broad categories:
cargo carriers, passenger carriers, tanker ships, bulk carriers, etc.Each category can be subdivided, 
with the first category containing by far the greatest number of subdivisions.
