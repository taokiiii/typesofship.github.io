<h2>Tanker Ships</h2>

<p>
A tanker (or tank ship or tankship) is a ship designed to transport or store liquids or gases in bulk.Major types of tankship include the oil tanker,
the chemical tanker, and gas carrier.Tankers also carry commodities such as vegetable oils, molasses and wine.In the United States Navy and Military
Sealift Command, a tanker used to refuel other ships is called an oiler(or replenishment oiler if it can also supply dry stores) but many other navies use
the terms tanker and replenishment tanker.

Tankers can range in size of capacity from several hundred tons, which includes vessels for servicing small harbours and coastal settlements
to several hundred thousand tons, for long-range haulage.Besides ocean- or seagoing tankers there are also specialized inland-waterway
tankers which operate on rivers and canals with an average cargo capacity up to some thousand tons A wide range of products are carried by tankers
