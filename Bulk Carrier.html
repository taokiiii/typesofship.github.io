<h2>Bulk Carrier</h2>

<p>
A bulk carrier or bulker is a merchant ship specially designed to transport unpackaged bulk cargo such as grains, coal, ore, steel coils, and cement — in its cargo holds.
Since the first specialized bulk carrier was built in 1852, economic forces have led to continued development of these ships, resulting in increased size and sophistication. 
Today's bulk carriers are specially designed to maximize capacity, safety, efficiency, and durability.
 
On bulk carriers, crews are involved in operation, management, and maintenance of the vessel  taking care of safety, navigation, maintenance, 
and cargo care, in accordance with international maritime legislation.

<p>
Bulk cargo can be very dense, corrosive, or abrasive. This can present safety problems that can threaten a ship: problems such as cargo shifting,
spontaneous combustion, and cargo saturation. . The use of old ships that have corrosion problems — as well as the bulk carriers' large hatchways — 
has been linked to a spate of bulk carrier sinkings in the 1990s. These large hatchways, important for efficient cargo handling, can allow the entry of
large volumes of water in storms or if the ship is endangered by sinking.
