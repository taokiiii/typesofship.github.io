<h2>Passenger Ships</h2>

<p>
A passenger ship is a merchant ship whose primary function is to carry passengers on the sea. The category does not include cargo vessels which have
accommodations for limited numbers of passengers, such as the ubiquitous twelve-passenger freighters once common on the seas in which the transport of passengers
 is secondary to the carriage of freight. The type does however include many classes of ships designed to transport substantial numbers of passengers as well as freight.

<p>
While typically passenger ships are part of the merchant marine, passenger ships have also been used as troopships and often are commissioned as naval ships
when used as for that purpose.
